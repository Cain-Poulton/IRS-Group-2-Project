Acknowledgement:
I have used the following Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools/services in the preparation of this assessment: 

- GenAI service name and version: ChatGPT (GPT-5) 
- Link to the GenAI service: https://chat.openai.com 
- Ways this GenAI service was used: 
  - Error Identification: Identifying errors from scripts and terminal outputs to identify dysfunctional communication between Ros2 nodes. 
  - Terminal Search Tool: To find terminal commands for the install of necessary PKGs such as Ros2 and Colcon. 
  - Suggested Solutions: Using proposed methods to solve errors post the identification process. No code was copied from generative AI but the proposed methods were independently programmed and implemented. 

I confirm that I have not used GenAI in the preparation of this assessment for any purpose other than what I have acknowledged above and I have cited and referenced any GenAI content in my assessment submission, applying the relevant referencing style. I understand that providing false or misleading information in this Gen AI Acknowledgement Statement may constitute a breach of the University of Canberra (Student Conduct) Rules 2023.
